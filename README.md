This is a Java project created in andriod studio as a class project aimed at teaching the fundamentals of mobile development.
This project is a game. To play the game you can choose either easy or hard mode, then swipe (or use the buttons at the bottom) right or down to move all the cats into the collection zone before the number of moves runs out.
Using a treat allows you to move more cats with the next swipe. You can also adjust the color of the collection zone.

This project has a class based state machine to handle states and can also rotate and remain fully functional.
